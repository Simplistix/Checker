Using Checker
=============

Once installed, checker is used by executing the the checker script.
This will look for a configuration, by default located in
:file:`/config`. The configuration location can be overriden with a
command line options to the checker script::

  checker -C /some/folder

.. -> command

  >>> print repr(command)

Within the configuration folder, Checker looks for a file called
:file:`checker.txt` that contains a list of rows defining the
configurations to be checked, for example:

.. topic:: checker.txt
 :class: file

 ::

   path:/some/folder
   path:/some/file
  
   # blank lines and lines starting with hashes are ignored.
   crontab:root
   svn:/some/checkout
   buildout:/some/buildout

.. -> checker_txt
 
  >>> print checker_txt

Each one of these lines starts with the name of a checker followed by
a colon. The remainder of the line is passed through to the checker
for it to find the configuration information it should be checking.
The checker may then write information to the configuration directory.

Once all the checkers have been run, an implict checker is run on the
configuration folder itself. At this time, only subversion is
supported for this implicit checker.

By default, any changes found by a checker are printed to stdout. This
makes checker ideal for running as a nightly cron job where the output
will be emailed to the user running the cron job.

However, on some systems, output from scheduled tasks is not emailed
to the user running the task. In this case, some special lines may be
added to :file:`checker.txt` as follows::

  email_to: recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
  email_from: sender@example.com
  email_subject: Checker output
  email_smtphost: localhost

.. -> checker_txt
 
  >>> print checker_txt

Only `email_to` is required, and once specified, if the other options
are not present, the following defaults will be used:

`email_from`
  The `email_to` value will be used if no `email_from` is supplied.

`email_subject`
  If not specified, the subject will default to the text::
 
    Checker output from 
   
  followed by the hostname of the machone on which Checker is run.

`email_smtphost`
  This defaults to `localhost`.
